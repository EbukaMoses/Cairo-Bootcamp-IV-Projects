# StarkPayBills  
Submission by **Guzbyte**

## ðŸ§¾ Project Description  
**StarkPayBills** is a decentralized utility bill payment platform built on **Starknet**. It allows users to pay for real-world utility services like electricity, airtime, water, and internet using stark tokens and other stablecoins and tokens such as **USDT**, **ETH**, **USDC**, or **STRK**. By combining Cairo smart contracts with a backend payment gateway, StarkPayBills bridges on-chain payments with off-chain service providers through secure APIs.

Users initiate and manage bills directly on-chain, while an off-chain backend service interacts with utility provider APIs to complete the actual service delivery. The system ensures transparency, traceability, and crypto-native access to essential services  especially valuable in regions with unreliable or centralized financial systems.

This project demonstrates how smart contracts can be combined with Web2 services to power real-world outcomes using Web3 infrastructure.
